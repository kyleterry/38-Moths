# 38-moths

![What](./screenshot.png?raw=true)

Bizarre web framework. Do not be afraid.

# Installation

You'll need to install some [dependencies.](http://vodka.shithouse.tv/) Then you
can just:

```
make
sudo make install
```

# Usage

See the examples directory. More to come later.

# Tests

Currently there are only tests for the `GRESHUNKEL` templating language. The
`Makefile` spits out a `greshunkel_test` binary that you can run.
